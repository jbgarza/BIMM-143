```{r}
zb <- read.table(file = 'mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv', sep='\t')
colnames(zb) <- c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "mismatch", "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore")
head(zb)
```


```{r}
## Asuming your blast results are stored in an object called 'b'
plot(zb$pident  * (zb$qend - zb$qstart), zb$bitscore)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(zb, aes(pident, bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) 
```

There appears to be a positive relationship between pident and bitscore as the data is positively correlated.

```{r}
ggplot(zb, aes((zb$pident * (zb$qend - zb$qstart)), bitscore)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) + geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
hist(zb$bitscore, breaks = 30)
```
As the bitscores increase, the frequency of high bitscores tends to decrease.
